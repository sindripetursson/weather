# Weather App by Sindri PÃ©tursson

This Weather App is a React-based application that provides real-time weather information and a 5-day forecast for any city, using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Online Demo

Access a live version of the app: [Live Demo](https://weather-a1cf4.web.app/)

## Run app locally

Before running the app, you'll need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and set it up in the project.

### Obtaining the OpenWeatherMap API Key

1. **Sign Up**: Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for an account.
2. **API Key**: Once registered, navigate to the API keys section in your account and generate a new API key.

### Setting Up the API Key

1. **Create a .env file**: In the root of the project, create a file named `.env`.
2. **Add API Key**: Inside the `.env` file, add the following line:

REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY="Your_OpenWeatherMap_API_Key"
Replace `Your_OpenWeatherMap_API_Key` with the API key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.

### Running the App

In the project directory, run:
- npm install
- npm start

This runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Instructions for Using the App

- **Search by City**: Users can enter a city name in the search input and click the search button to get weather information for that city.
- **Location-Based Search**: Users can also click the location button to get weather information based on their current geographical location.

## Extra features

- The app automatically switches to dark mode when displaying information for cities in their AM hours.
